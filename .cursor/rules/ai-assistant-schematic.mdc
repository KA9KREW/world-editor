# AI Assistant Schematic Format

When the user asks to generate a building, structure, or schematic for the world editor, output valid JSON in this format:

```json
{
  "blocks": {
    "x,y,z": blockId,
    "0,0,0": 17,
    "1,0,0": 10,
    "0,1,0": 56
  },
  "entities": [
    {
      "position": [x, y, z],
      "entityName": "oak-tree",
      "rotation": [0, 0, 0]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Rules
- **blocks**: Object mapping position keys `"x,y,z"` (integers) to block IDs (numbers)
- **entities** (optional): Array of `{ position: [x,y,z], entityName: string, rotation?: [x,y,z] }`
- Block IDs come from `src/js/blocks/block-manifest.json` (e.g. 17=cobblestone, 10=bricks, 56=grass, 31=dirt, 5=birch-log)
- Origin (0,0,0) is typically ground level; Y increases upward
- Keep structures small (5–20 blocks) unless asked otherwise

## Example prompts that trigger this
- "Generate a schematic for a small stone hut"
- "Create a 3x3 brick tower for the world editor"
- "Make a schematic for a wooden cabin"

Respond with **only the JSON** so the user can paste it into the AI Assistant's "Paste from Cursor" field.
